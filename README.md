# Delhi Public Services Index

## Description

This repository includes code to generate a spatial index of services for Delhi, based on the forthcoming paper "Towards an Urban Public Services Index" from Georgetown's [Urban Spatial Observatory](https://www.urbanspatialobservatory.org/). Although the data is not provided in this repository, the scripts and Jupyter notebooks can be used to generate an urban public services index in another city.

## Requirements

Create a `conda` virtual environment with:
```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

Note that this list of requirements includes commonly used GIS tools in Python. You can see the list of packages at the Automating GIS Processes Python installation [page](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/course-info/Installing_Anacondas_GIS.html#the-easiest-way).
